#Ni JIT

Ni aims to provide a module that just makes Python faster.

Ni is based on a fork of Armin Rigo's Psyco, Armin and the other Psyco
developers moved onto PyPy so go check that out if you want a high performance
implementation of Pythoni (http://pypy.org).

Ni is not currently alpha software and not fit for use. It will be several
months before it is ready to release.
