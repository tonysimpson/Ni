/* "Frames": the Python compiler may be interrupted between the
   compilation of two opcodes. Any local data it needs that should
   persist across such interruptions must be stored in the PsycoObject
   driving compilation. The PsycoObject plays the same role as the
   FrameObject in normal interpretation. The usual fields of
   FrameObjects are split into two groups:

   1) in the 'vlocals' array, as 'vinfo_t' structures. This makes
      dynamically-staged variables, that is, whose value may be known
      at compile-time, run-time or virtual-time only. Use the LOC_xxx
      macros to access these variables.

   2) in the 'pr' field whose structure is defined below. For
      compile-time-only data.

   IMPORTANT: the dispatcher only looks at LOC_xxx variables to
   determine if the needed code has already be compiled. If two
   PsycoObjects differ only by their 'pr' field, the code that
   the compiler would emit in each case must be interchangeable
   (but not necessary identical, as different optimizations
   could be done).

/* Note.
   'stack_level' is stored in 'pr'. To do so we must assume that the level
   of the interpreter value stack is always the same when execution reaches
   the same position in the bytecode. This is normally the case in Python,
   with a few exceptions that need to be worked around ('finally:' clauses
   in the original interpreter are invoked with a variable number of objects
   pushed on the stack; the present interpreter always only pushes one,
   grouping objects in a tuple if necessary (remember that tuples are
   abstracted to virtual-time, so this doesn't mean we loose time building
   and deconstructing Python tuples)).

   The same assumption holds for the other fields of pyc_data_t but only
   'stack_level' needs special care.
